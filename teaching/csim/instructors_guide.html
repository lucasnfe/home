      <p>This course was design to be taught in the <a href="">Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer (SPCS) Institute</a>.
         Every SPCS course is three weeks long with 2.5 hours of lecture in the morning and 3h of study in the afternoon.
         Thus, all the slides and homework assigments were designed to attend this requirements. In general, all the lectures
         have 2/3 of theory and 1/3 of live coding, so at the end of each lecture, a new functional build is released with
         the techniques discussed that day. The material contains 35 hours of lectures, which could be easily divided in 10 weeks
         for a quarter-based course with 2 lectures of 1:45h of duration. It is also possible to extend this course to be one
         semester long. This could be achieved by spending more time on each of the major topics: Programming, Game Design,
         Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics. <p>

      <h4>Course Description</h4>

      <p>This course introduces students to the fundaments of computer simulations in the context of interactive media.
         Students are exposed to tools and techniques for modeling physics, intelligent agents (behaviors) and visual
         effects in order to design expressive interactive media. This course also covers the foundations of game
         design, including theories that drive the process of making interactive games. Moreover, students learn
         programming in Lua inside the PICO-8 platform, which is a fantasy console that is used for all
         the homework assignments. </p>

      <p>This is a studio based course, so students are expected to produce a working prototype (with graphics,
          sound and controls) for each topic covered in class in addition to a final project. The final project
          is a creative interactive simulation fully designed and implemented by them. Students are encouraged
          to work in groups so they can simulate a creative working environment (like a game studio), where
          they share knowledge and develop their communication skills. At the end of the course, all the 
          projects are posted to the PICO-8 online digital library.</p>

    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>

        <p>CSIM was designed for students with no prior experience in programming. However, due to time constraints, there are only two lectures focusing specially on this topic.
           Thus, it is very helpful if they have some notions of computer programming. </p>
        <p>This course has substantial elements of both programming, physics and mathematics, because these elements are central to computer simulations.
            Students should be prepared to review basic Classical Mechanics and Trigonometry on their own if it is not fresh in their heads.</p>

    <h4>Programming Language</h4>
        <p>Course programming assignments are done in PICO-8, which is a platform that can be programmed in Lua. Prior experience with the language
            is not assumed, but we do expect them to learn the basics rapidly. Assignments 1 and 2 are designed to teach them the basics of Lua and PICO-8.
            The content present in this course is completely uncoupled from Lua or PICO-8. Thus, it should be simple to adapt
            the course to any other platform or programming language.</a></p>

    <h4>Assignments</h4>
        <p>This class includes <b>eleven programming projects</b> and <b>one creative project</b>. In the first week, the assigments
        are expected to be completed in 3h. After that, the assigments are 1h long, leaving 2h for the students to work on their project.</p>

    <h4>Grading</h4>
        <p>SPCS courses are not graded, so students are encouraged to give their best without the fear of failing.</p>

    <h4>Textbook</h4>
        <p>No textbook is required for this course. However the material presented here heavily references the following: </p>
