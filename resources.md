VGMIDI is a dataset of 200 MIDI labelled piano pieces and 728 non-labelled ones, all
piano arrangements of video game soundtracks. Each piece was annotated by 30 human subjects according to a
valence-arousal (dimensional) model of emotion. The sentiment of each piece was then extracted by summarizing
the 30 annotations and mapping the valence axis to sentiment. The dataset is available on
<a href="https://github.com/lucasnfe/vgmidi">github</a>.
