### About
I'm broadly interested in the intersections between Artificial Intelligence and Creativity, specifically in
algorithmic music composition, generative art, and procedural content generation for games. I'm currently working on controlling generative deep learning models to compose music with a given emotion. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu) (UCSC), a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the [Universidade de São Paulo](http://www.usp.br) (USP), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universidade Federal do Paraná](http://www.ufpr.br) (UFPR).
