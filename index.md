### About
I'm broadly interested in the intersections between Artificial Intelligence and Creativity, specifically in
algorithmic music composition, generative art, and procedural content generation for games. I'm currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), working on controlling generative deep learning models to compose music with a given emotion. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu) (UCSC), a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www.usp.br) (USP), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universidade Federal do Paraná](https://www.ufpr.br) (UFPR).
