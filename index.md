### About
I'm broadly interested in the intersections between Machine Learning and Creativity, specifically in
algorithmic music composition and procedural content generation for games. I'm currently working on
controlling generative deep learning models to compose music with a given emotion. I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">University of California, Santa Cruz</a> (UCSC), a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.usp.br">Universidade de São Paulo </a> (USP), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science
from <a href="http://www.ufpr.br">Universidade Federal do Paraná</a> (UFPR).
