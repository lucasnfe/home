    <h3>Student's Guide</h3>

    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
    <p>Homework assigments are to be submitted individually but may be discussed in groups. Students are allowed
    and encouraged to ask problem clarification questions, discuss general solution approaches and resolve Lua syntax problems.
    However, they can't share code for entire routines or algorithms.</p>

    <h4>Submissions</h4>
    <p>Homework assigments must be turned in electronically via Google Drive by 3:30pm on the same day they were assigned.

    <h4>Ethics</h4>
    <p>Submissions should acknowledge all collaborators and sources consulted. All code and written responses should
    be original. We trust you all to submit your own work. </p>

    <h4>Support</h4>
    <p>Please sign up to our <a href="https://stanford-csim17-2.slack.com">Slack Channel</a>, and use this
        forum to discuss the materials with other students and ask questions to the instructor/TAs. </p>
